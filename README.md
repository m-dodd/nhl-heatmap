# NHL Heatmap

This project was my component of a group project completed as part of Data 601 at the University of Calgary.

The idea for this project is quite simple - I wanted to create a hockey visualization of goal and shot locations.
* By Season
* By Team
* By Game
* By Playoff Game
* Per Player

The project was completed in Jupyter Notebooks and uses plotly to draw the rink surface and generate the heat map. Unfortunately, I have not found a  way to convert this project into a nice `html` page due to using the `ipywidgets`. I hope you take the opportunity to build this project yourself with the notebook I have provided so that you can play around with the interface and enjoy it int he same way that I have, but if not I have provided some screenshots so that you can get a feel for the interface and the application.
