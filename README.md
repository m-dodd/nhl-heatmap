# NHL Heatmap

This project was my component of a group project completed as part of Data 601 at the University of Calgary.

The idea for this project is quite simple - I wanted to create a hockey visualization of goal and shot locations.
* By Season
* By Team
* By Game
* By Playoff Game
* Per Player

The project was completed in Jupyter Notebooks and uses plotly to draw the rink surface and generate the heat map. Unfortunately, I have not found a  way to convert this project into a nice `html` page due to using the `ipywidgets`. I hope you take the opportunity to build this project yourself with the notebook I have provided so that you can play around with the interface and enjoy it int he same way that I have, but if not I have provided some screenshots so that you can get a feel for the interface and the application.

## Season

The first screenshot will show what an entire season of shots looks like. It also gives an overview of the interface and the different ways that you can interact with the application to gather the insights you want.

## Player

We all think we know how Ovechkin plays, but have you ever seen it visualized? It's quite startling and amazing. With this app we can visualize the shots and goals of any player in the 2018-2019 season.
